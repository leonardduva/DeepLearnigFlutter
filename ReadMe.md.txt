Hello everyone! 

Welcome to the Complete Flutter Deep Learning Course!

	In order to run apps make sure you run 'flutter pub get' to get all the dependencies before building your project!! :)
	In order to run python scripts, make sure you have the appropriate datasets installed in the same directory!
	
	If you have any problems, feel free to ask me questions on Udemy! 
	I hope you all have a great time with this course :)
